** Groan zoneâ„¢
A time to align and to allow group-based ideas to emerge
** Each step takes as long as it needs to
Trying to shorten or skip a step can cause participants to disconnect and stop sharing responsibility for success

/Participatory/ means anyone can call for closure, must get group agreement to move forward.
** You can make steps more effective by choosing the appropriate exercise

- brainstorming
- multi-topic, multi-station
** Structured go-arounds

* The role of facilitator
** Help the group get to its goal

** Get a Facilitator's hat
It doesn't have to be a hat.

You are not a part of the conversation.
** You're here to hold space
Everyone in the group needs to be comfortable with participating.

This is on YOU.
** Okay but concretely?
- Manage the tensions of the conversations
- Be cognizant of the time
- Give only as much information as you need to
- Allow everyone to be involved
- Be ready for emotions to surface
- Allow the group to come to its own decisions
