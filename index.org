** Groan zone™
A time to align and to allow group-based ideas to emerge
** Each step takes as long as it needs to
Trying to shorten or skip a step can lead to trouble

/Participatory/ means anyone can call for closure, must get group agreement to move forward.
** You can make steps more effective by choosing the appropriate exercise

- Finding themes
- Choosing topic
- Exploring conditions
- Making decision(s)

 - usual exercise: affinity mapping
** Choosing topic

** Exploring conditions
- emergent
- usual exercise: mind-map
** Making decisions

* The role of facilitator
** Help the group get to its goal

** Get a Facilitator's hat
It doesn't have to be a hat.

You are not a part of the conversation.
** You're here to hold space
Holding space means to be with someone without judgment. To donate your ears and heart without wanting anything back. To practice empathy and compassion.

** Okay but concretely?
- Manage the tensions of the conversations
- Be cognizant of the time
- Give only as much information as you need to
- Allow everyone to be involved
- Be ready for emotions to surface
- Allow the team to come to its own decisions
